I am trying to write a blog about generating personal homepage using cursor in 1 minutes. So here is
the task for you. I need you to generate one website at a time, when I tell you to generate. for each webpage, please create a new folder in `blog/assets/examplary_websites/` with an
`index.html` file, a `styles.css` file, and if needed, a `script.js` file. 

here is a prompt for you to generate the website (what you are reading now is more like an
overarching prompt.)

```reusable_prompt
Hi cursor, I would like to generate a personal website where I can showcase my research results and teaching experience. You don't have to generate everything at a time. But would be good to have an index.html page, an about.html page, and so on. Put all the styling design in a single css file. .JS file if needed. 
```

# Variables that you can tweak for each webpage:
1. The color scheme. Please make sure you only use 2-3 Hues for the color scheme. They needs to blend in harmony and there should be one main color and assistant color from those 2-3 colors Hues.
2. Different layout is also preferred. You don’t have to follow the “top-to-down navigation bar content footer” kinda design. It could be a “left-and-right” design or anything you could think of. But please make sure it falls in the popular design layout pool, and it is not something you invented. 
3. You could design some placeholder images, color blocks, logos, make-up profiles if you like.
4. I want to see differernt design style. I want diversity in the design. (examples: apple liquid
   glass, flat design, minimalistic design, maximalist design, pastel color scheme, etc.)


# task list:
- create a html file in `blog/` based on `blog/assets/md/ai-webpage-generating.md`. please read an
  instruction document in `blog/assets/docs/blog-post-workflow.md`. remember to update the
  index.html file in `blog/` after you generate the website.
- feed yourself with the prompt mentioned above. And ask me if I want to start generating an
  examplary webpage. Please do it once at a time.
- put it in the `blog/assets/md/ai-webpage-generating.md` gallary section. 
- ask me if I want to continue generating more examplary webpages. and repeat the process.

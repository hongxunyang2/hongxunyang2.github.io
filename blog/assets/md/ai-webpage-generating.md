# AI-assisted 1-minute webpage creation
In this post, I will share my experience of using AI to create a webpage in 1 minute. 

here is the story if you are interested (^guide-for-cursor:wrap it up like you did in `blog/ai-restructure-code.html`)
```story
I learnt to build websites before the AI era. I had to write my own tedious HTML and CSS files on my own. I am a art person and I was so obsessed with designing and colouring. I pretty much spent 80% if the time moving elemnts around, redesigning and tweaking. This is fun but in fact it is so time consuming. It kinda reminds me of the pixel drawing experience when I played animal crossing. Can you imaging using a joy-con doing pixel art and drawing an entire swimming pool for 5 hours? This is pretty much what it was like for me to construct and maintain my webpage.

And then there came ChatGPT and later Gemini, cursor, and codex. It totally changed the way we build website. People no longer need to take care of the design, or in general, the frontend part of everything. This includes the CSS part of the website design, the GUI design for any software. 

This is the story going around and there is a real hype about the frontend power of AI. I got to realize that it is a real thing when I was trying to help a friend with building her personal website. A short prompt in 1 minute and a couple of iteration and super fancy liquid-glass-like website just poped up. i was shocked how good-looking it could be and how fast it was created. I have to say that a 5-year experience in webpage designing is no where close to this AI's capability. 

Because of this, I didn't even bother doing any frontend job by myself. AI is straight up better than you, and faster.

# Gallary
You could click on the following webpages to take a look at the website generated by cursor with the
prompt mentioned above. 

(^guide-for-cursor: please design a gallary-like webpage showcase. in each examplary webpage there
should be an image called impression.jpg. for each website you show the impression image of that
page, and a short description about the layout and the color scheme.)

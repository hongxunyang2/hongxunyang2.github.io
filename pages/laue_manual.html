<p>Installing softwares</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/qlaue/">Qlaue</a>: this is a software for simulating Laue diffraction patterns.</li>
<li><a href="https://jp-minerals.org/vesta/en/download.html">Vesta</a>: this is a software for visualizing crystal structures. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>A quick look at the crystal structure and the corresponding Laue pattern </p>
<ul>
<li>Most of the crystal can be looked up on the website <a href="http://www.crystallography.net/cod/">Crystallography open database</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.crystallography.net/cod/5000216.html">Copper crystallographic data</a>. look at the crystal structure and download the <a href="/files/copper_5000216.cif">CIF file</a>. Open up Vesta, load the CIF file and visualize the crystal structure.</li>
<li>Open up Qlaue, type in information of copper and simulate the Laue pattern. </li>
<li>Questions: what are the symmetries of the copper structure? How are these symmetry reflected in the Laue diffraction pattern?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Quick Laue setup</p>
<ul>
<li>Turn both computers on. Press the power button on the bottom under the Laue machine and press the <code>reset</code> button.</li>
<li>The computer on the left is for controlling the robot arm. The labview program can be started up in <code>robotarm/RobotarmControlVz.vi</code>. Run the program by clicking the arrow icon, and click the <code>reset error</code> button.</li>
<li>The computer on the right is for displaying the camera images and aquiring the Laue diffraction image. The camera app can be opened up in ``; The Laue program can be started up by clicking Pviewer -&gt; camera -&gt; dualxxx -&gt; clicking the setting icon. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mounting sample</p>
<ul>
<li>bring out copper piece from the sample container. </li>
<li>stick double-side tape onto the goniometer. (stick it to the right side of the goniometer!!!)</li>
<li>stick the copper piece to the tape. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Installiing the goniometer into the Laue machine</p>
<ul>
<li>Put the goniometer to the starting position inside the Laue machine. </li>
<li>On the computer on the left, click <code>get goniometer</code> button. Remember to oversee the whole process in case the goniometer is not grabed properly. Keep the door open and always be ready to adjust the position of the goniometer. The final position of the goniometer should be right before the CCD (X-ray detector). </li>
<li>adjust the x,y position on the computer on the right, to move it further away from the CCD, in order for the needle to fit in between the goniometer and the CCD. </li>
<li>The needle is to align the CCD to the X-ray source. When the needle is put down, look at the camera image on the right computer, toggle <code>xy jogging</code> of the robot arm on the left computer. Starting adjusting the position of the goniometer so that it aligns with the needle. </li>
<li>Once the alignment is done, pull up the needle again. Adjust the position of the goniometer so that it moves closer to the CCD. (183 is the optimal position).</li>
<li>Close the door of the Laue machine. Now you are all set to start the measurement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Acquiring Laue diffraction pattern </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ensure the door of the Laue machine is tightly closed (to avoid radiation!)</strong> </li>
<li>Turn on the X-ray source by toggling the button on the top of the machine. Wait until the current gets stable. </li>
<li>On the right computer, set the initial acquisition time (conventionally ranging from 1 to 180 seconds). Click <code>snap</code> icon (not <code>play</code>) and wait. If you see the pattern, you could adjust the filter parameters to get a better image. If not, the X-ray might not be on the sample, and therefore you might need to adjust the position of the sample again until you find the diffraction pattern. </li>
<li>Create a folder for today's lab. Remember to save the image once you obtain a good one.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Qualitative analysis</p>
<ul>
<li>Purely from the Laue image, ask yourself: <em>What's the orientation of this sample?</em>, and <em>why?</em>. </li>
<li>Pull up your Qlaue simulation, find the potential orientation. Ask yourself: <em>Do they really match in a way?</em>, <em>If not, why</em>. There are some parameters to consider: (1) distance between the sample and the CCD; (2) The <code>phi</code> orientation; (3) The <code>theta</code> and <code>chi</code> orientation. All those parameters will affect the Laue pattern.</li>
<li>You can adjust the parameters in Qlaue to make it more similar to the real Laue pattern.</li>
<li>If possible, overlay the simulation onto the real image. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Steps before changing the sample</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Turn off the X-ray!!</strong></li>
<li>Toggle off the <code>xy jogging</code> icon. Click <code>put back gonio</code> icon to put it back to the initial position. </li>
<li>Open the door and take out the goniometer.</li>
<li>Take out the sample, wash it with Acetone and put it back to the container. Return it to where it belongs to.</li>
<li>Now you are ready for the next sample.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="something-to-keep-in-mind-during-the-experiment">Something to keep in mind during the experiment</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Turn off the X-ray</strong> whenevery you are about to open the door of the Laue machine.</li>
<li><strong>Note down everything worthwhile</strong>: take notes, take pictures, make screenshot of everything you think is worth putting into the lab report. And remember to send all the files to your own email after the lab. </li>

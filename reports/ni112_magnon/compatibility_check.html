                <p>So far I have rewritten the matlab+C codes into python. There are a couple of things I need to check
to make sure everything is correct.</p>
<h3>Oldest Matlab codes</h3>
<p>In the oldest Matlab codes, the fit involves a self-consistent loop to update the renormalized factor $Z_c$. The purpose is that
directly calculating $Z_c$ is very computational expensive. Typically each fit requires
evaluation of the fit function $\tilde{\omega}$ at least 100 times, which means the factor
$Z_c$ is calculated 100 times for each fit. This is very time consuming. Therefore, Bastine came
up with an idea (see Bastine's thesis, page 131): a two-step self-consistent fitting procedure
is used: </p>
<p><br></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>set $Z_c = 1.156$, a constant as an initial guess. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fit the experimental magnon dispersion with parameters $(U, t, t^{\prime}, t^{\prime\prime})$
   using the formula $\tilde{\omega} = Z_c(k) \cdot \omega(k\,|\, U, t, t^{\prime},
   t^{\prime\prime})$. Keep in mind that in this step during the fit, $Z_c$ is not updated. It's a
   function only of $k$, but not of $U, t, t^{\prime}, t^{\prime\prime}$. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This fit will give us a set of best parameters $(U, t, t^{\prime}, t^{\prime\prime})$. These
   parameters can be used to calculate the renormalized factor $Z_c(k\, |\, U, t, t^{\prime},
   t^{\prime\prime})$ using the formula Eq.3.5.60 in Bastine's thesis. Only now we update the $Z_c$
   to be a function of $U, t, t^{\prime}, t^{\prime\prime}$. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compare this newly-calculated $Z_c$ with the old one, if the difference is less than a threshold,
   the fit converges. Otherwise, update the $Z_c$ and repeat the process from step 2. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Notice that even in the oldest matlab code, the last step is not "repeat the process until the fit
converges", but rather "repeat the process 10 times". </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This self-consistent loop only requires calculation of the $Z_c$ 10 times, instead of typicall 100
times. It saves time for sure. However, it's not guaranteed 10 times is enough to converge, nor it
will converge at all. The safest way is, however, to allow $Z_c$ to vary during the fit, aka. make
$Z_c$ a function of the parameters $(U, t, t^{\prime}, t^{\prime\prime})$ in the equation
$\tilde{\omega} = Z_c(k\,|\, U, t, t^{\prime}, t^{\prime\prime}) \cdot \omega(k\,|\, U, t,
t^{\prime}, t^{\prime\prime})$. Although this approach is more time consuming, it's robust and it's
guaranted to be correct. We temporarily call this approach as "direct-$Z_c$-calculation method".</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Therefore, we need to check whether this approach is really valid, by comparing the results
obtained from this process with the results obtained from the fit process where $Z_c$ is directly
calculated.</strong></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We can use the old LCO data to do the test.</p>
<p><br></p>

<h3>Matlab codes for fitting SCO data in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-49714-y">THIS</a> paper</h3>
<p>Somehow in the matlab codes for fitting the SCO data, the self-consistent loop is not implemented.
In effect, the $Z_c$ is fixed at its initial value 1.156 during the entire fitting process. And only
after we obtained the best parameters set $(U, t, t^{\prime}, t^{\prime\prime})$, $Z_c$ is
calculated. At this point, even if the resulting $Z_c$ is $k$-dependent, it's not used in the fit.
During the fit, $Z_c$ is neither $k$-dependent nor updated. </p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Therefore, we need to redo the fit process with the old method (self-consistent loop) and the new
method (direct calculation of $Z_c$).</strong></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The best outcome will be that they are all the same. But we have to be prepared for the case where
at least one of them gives different results. </p>
<p><br></p>

<h3>Jargons:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Self-consistent-loop method</strong>: The method used by the oldest matlab codes where the $Z_c$ is
  updated within a self-consistent loop, but is kept unchanged during the fit. See the first
  section. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Direct-$Z_c$-calculation method</strong>: the method where $Z_c$ is varying during the fit. It's a function
  of the parameters $(U, t, t^{\prime}, t^{\prime\prime})$. </p>
</li>
</ul>

### Comments regarding the positive aspects concerning the instructor (optional):
- He was always very available and willing to answer questions. He admitted when he was wrong and took students questions very seriously.
- I really like his approach, gives the best to help us to imagine the problem and sketch it on the paper. On the other hand, Mr. Hong
organises interactive exercises where all of us can solve the problem on the black board and
disscuss with the group.
- The exersices are great and I really see the effort that is put into them. They are great to understand the lecture content better.
- very instructive exercise sheets
- Very pleasant all around.

### What other aspects concerning the instructor do you think need improvement? (Optional)
- I think at times some things in the exercise class were a bit drawn out and being able to redirect the conversation and continue on the
content would be best.
- Maybe in exersice class the ones to present should be picked at random cause otherwise always the same few present
- Besides for having a bit more structure in the course in terms of redirecting some tangential conversations, it was a really nice exercise
class.

### Other comments
- I could tell he put a lot of time into these questions and honestly they were some of the best composed questions I have had in physics. It
felt like they led you through the topic, without giving too much, and still allow us to learn and makes mistakes. Really cannot compliment
the way these were written enough.
- The exersices help a lot to understand the content of the lecture

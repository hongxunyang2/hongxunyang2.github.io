- Exercise 1b is the hardest, since the only method to do the fit is by brute force with enough data
points.
- I really liked it cause I like to fit data. Hardest was probably b)
- I had difficulty with estimating the exponents on the non-log plots (fig 2 and 3), perhaps there's
a useful tool for that.
- Biggest challenge was extracting the data from the plots for fitting.
- I did not find any part particularly difficult, but after talking with others I would imagine if I
did try to upload the data instead of just using numbers from the plot it would have been harder.

- i liked the sheet very much, especially ex2 and ex3 were very instructive. i think you're doing a
good job getting us to think about the physics behind the math. difficulty was fine for all
exercises.
- I really appreciated exercise 2 and 3, I think those concepts were never explained to me in that
way and it really helped my understanding and intuition. The hardest, I thought, was probably 3 even
though I did not get around to finishing it. And I spent the most time on 1 because I really wanted
to review some concepts and make sure I understood it a bit better, though I think more discussion
today will be fruitful.  
- This week I was very busy so I could only do one exersice. But The optional ones do seem more
relevant to the lecture
- No time to really work on it

#8
- difficulty was good. ex2 a3 took me the longest. an intuitive explanation of ex2 a4 and b4 would
be nice in exercise class
- It was long for the fact wasn't uploaded in the last "working" week. Otherwise the exercises were
good :)
- I somehow did 2(b1) with Lagrangian mechanics instead and classical mechanics is hard as usual :)
- good exercise sheet!
- I appreciate the step by step process in the sheet and how it guides us through the thinking, but
I found it a bit difficult with the changing of the sheet that every time I went back it seemed like
something was new or changed.  
- 1b) was not clear for me

#9
- You could explain the more detailed derivation of flux quantization, because the way to treat the
mechanical momentum is not obvious.
- Variational derivative is challenging in terms of math, but overall straight forward.
- Completely fine.
- Really enjoyed the sheet a lot of very insightfull exercises that really helped digesting the
lecture
- Personally short on time but great exercise!
- Very nice sheet!
- I enjoyed the sheet, especially the derivation of the london equation using Landau theory was very
nice

#10
- Can we look at SQUIDS and how one measurement works with all its physics behind?
- Very good accordance to lecture. really helped deepen my understanding of the lecture material
- exercise 3a was the most difficult, but over all difficulty was good
- :)
- unfortunatley no time to work on it
